# SIMPLE UNIX SHELL :shell:

## Description :page_with_curl:

This is a simple implementation of a UNIX command line interpreter. The shell can interpret and execute command line arguments read from the standard input. the shell read lines from a file or terminal line which is then interpreted and executed if the command is valid

## Requirements

- All the files are to be compiled on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine with:
  `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c `
- All files ends end with a new line, with no memory leaks
- All code will use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- All code will be tested using the test files in the test folder.
- The simple shell supports most shell commands, such as `cat`, `pwd`,` ls -la` and more.

## Return Value :

The shell returns a value of 0 if the command is valid and the command is executed successfully.

## Output :file_folder:

- The program must have the exact same output as `sh (/bin/sh)` as well as the exact same error output.
- The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to the `argv[0]`

## Usage

- write (man 2 write)

0. Betty would be proud
mandatory
Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks

1. Simple shell 0.1
mandatory
Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

Usage: simple_shell
Your Shell should:

Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
Handle errors.
You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
You don’t have to:

use the PATH
implement built-ins
handle special characters : ", ', `, \, *, &, #
be able to move the cursor
handle commands with arguments
execve will be the core part of your Shell, don’t forget to pass the environ to it…

3. Simple shell 0.3
mandatory
Simple shell 0.2 +

Handle the PATH
fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist

4. Simple shell 0.4
mandatory
Simple shell 0.3 +

Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
Usage: exit
You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit

5. Simple shell 1.0
mandatory
Simple shell 0.4 +

Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
